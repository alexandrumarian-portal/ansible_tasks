1. First, you have to create a vaulted file where we’ll store the passwords.
When you run this command it will ask you to create a password and then an empty file will show up.

ansible-vault create secrets.yml

Add some passwords there and save the file.
	
mysql_pwd: "DifficultPassword"
ht_pwd: "PasswordXYZ"


ansible-vault edit secrets.yaml


2. If you look at the file now, you’ll see that it’s encrypted and you can’t see the passwords anymore.
If you want to edit the file do ansible-vault edit secrets.yaml and enter the vault password.
Create a small playbook that displays the password:

# centos-vault.yml
---
- hosts: centos
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml
 
  tasks:
  - name: Show mysql pwd
    debug:
      msg: "{{ mysql_pwd }}"
